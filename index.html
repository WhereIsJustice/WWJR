                <p>Mr. Yasser and me kept constant and active contact via either email or mobile phone.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Mr. Yasser Khaleel promised to help on speeding up the payment.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>From May, 2016 ---- August, 2017.</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>JCP paid in total of USD 30,000. Under the situation which I kept making phone call from July of 2016.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Left&nbsp;<strong>USD 15,100 outstanding.</strong></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>During this time peroid, my first contact had been&nbsp;<strong>Mr. Yasser Khaleel, </strong>till&nbsp;late
            of 2017 there was no way for me to reach this person.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If I made contact with Mr. Yasser Khaleel, I was told by Mr. Yasser that he will look into the
                    payment issue, or this and that. Did Mr. Yasser really help? I do not know.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>During this time peroid, my second contat was&nbsp;<strong>Mr. Elsayed Shekew</strong>, one of the managers
            as quoted above from <a href="http://www.jamescubittandpartners.com/offices.html" rel="nofollow">JCP's
                website.</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The only way I can get in touch with JCP is through telephone which is listed above&nbsp;<strong>+974-446-65216</strong>

<h1>Story of the outstanding, USD 15,100.</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>From Feb, 2018 --- 4th,March,2019 my first contact had been&nbsp;<strong>Mr. Elsayed Shekew.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>After talked with Mr. Elsayed Shekew on 4th,March,2019 via phone, I strongly felt there is no point
                    for me to keep on calling and asking for the payment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I stopped calling JCP and decided to document and release this whole thing to the internet.</p>
            </li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The second conact had been&nbsp;<strong>Mr.Wali</strong>, one of the accountants. I do not know if I get his
            name correct.</p>

Yeah, actually the status now we found a positive response from the client. So that's why we are trying to get it from this side. Finally. We said decided that we will make a case for him and the court but he said okay, he will be transferred to his.</p>
